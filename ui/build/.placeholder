# Placeholder file for go:embed directive
# This file ensures ui/build/* pattern works in CI/development environments
# Real build files will overwrite this directory during the build process

This is a placeholder file to satisfy the //go:embed ui/build/* directive in main.go.
The actual build process will replace this with real build artifacts.
